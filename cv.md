## About Me

## Skills

## Code example

This is the last KATA that I solved on the [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com).

**[Breaking chocolate problem (7 kyu)](https://www.codewars.com/kata/534ea96ebb17181947000ada/javascript)**

Split the chocolate bar of given dimension `n x m` into small squares.\
Each square is of size `1x1` and unbreakable. Implement a function that will return minimum number of breaks needed.\
If input data is invalid you should return 0. Input will always be a non-negative integer.

```
function breakChocolate(n,m) {
  if (n > 0 && m > 0 {
  return n * m - 1;
  } else {
    return 0;
  };
}
```
## Development experience
Now I'm developing a commercial system for calculating and accounting orders in the printing studio where I work.
